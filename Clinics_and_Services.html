                        <p>
                        Health insurance is financial protection in case of illness or injury. It allows patients to receive medical care
                        without incurring significant out-of-pocket costs. The main idea is that, for a moderate monthly fee, a client gains
                        access to a wide range of healthcare services — from consultations to hospitalization.

                        <h3> Diagnostics and Lab Tests</h3>
                        <p>Most insurance plans include coverage for diagnostic procedures such as MRI, CT scans, ultrasounds,
                            blood tests, and
                            screenings. This helps detect illnesses at early stages and begin timely treatment.</p>

                        <span><h3>Consultation Services</h3>
                        <p>One of the basic services in health insurance includes free or partially covered doctor
                            consultations. This can be a
                            general practitioner or specialists such as a cardiologist, dermatologist, or gastroenterologist.
                            Some insurance
                            companies also offer online consultations with doctors.</p></span>

                        <h3>Hospitalization and Inpatient Care</h3>
                        <p>A health insurance policy often covers the cost of hospital stays, including surgeries, medications,
                            meals, and even
                            accommodation in a hospital ward. More advanced plans may allow patients to choose a private room or
                            clinic.</p>
